# Lab 01: RandomWalker 

1. Read the following problem. DO NOT READ FAST. 
   
    A drone begins flying aimlessly, starting at Nassau Hall (0, 0). At each time step, the drone flies one meter in a random direction, either north, east, south, or west, with probability 25%. How far will the drone be from Nassau Hall after n steps? This process is known as a two-dimensional random walk.

    Write a program RandomWalker.java that takes an integer user input n and simulates the motion of a random walk for n steps. Print the location at each step (including the
starting point), treating the starting point as the origin (0, 0). Finally, print the square of the final Euclidean distance from the origin.

3. Discuss with your partner about an optimal possible solution. **DO NOT WRITE ANY CODE YET.**
   
4. Write at least one paragrath explaining your solution in the file solution.txt. Please be clear.
   
5. Write the java program RandomWalker. You will probably need to generate a random number. Use this: double randomNum = Math.random();
